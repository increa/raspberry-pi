On the Raspberry Pi, enter the command:
unbuffer ./mon-temp 2>&1 | tee junk.txt

Unbuffer is required to overcome the bash tty queue of data; without it there would be no program output for many minutes.
mon-temp is the python script in the current directory
combine stderr with stdout and pipe to the tee program
save data in filename of your choice.

After program has run for a while, use ^C to stop it.  Or leave it running while you snag data over to your Windows 10 computer.

Use OpenSSH installed on Windows to get a copy of the data file.
You'll need to create a Win10 key pair and upload the public key to the Linux box; I use putty.

On the Win 10 command line, enter the command:
scp pi@192.168.x.x:junk.txt junk.txt

This will create a copy of the data file in your present directory.

Run excel and plot the data.
